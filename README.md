# Happiness Tracker

# About

A smartphone software called Happiness Tracker lets you monitor and improve your level of happiness every day. The new field of positive psychology serves as the foundation for the application. Thus, the application will consistently convey positive messages both directly and indirectly, through words or images (e.g., Mother Teresa, "I will never attend an anti-war rally; if you have a peace rally, invite me"). More specifically, the labelling and thankfulness theory serves as the foundation for the application's features. In practice, the software asks you, "How do you feel?" a set number of times throughout the day, prompts you to write down something for which you are thankful once a day, and then, at various points throughout the day, uses alerts to display some uplifting and labelling phrases.
